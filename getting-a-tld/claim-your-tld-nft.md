# Claim your TLD NFT

To start your own TLD head on to our website: [**Here**](https://alldomains.id/search-tld)\
\
Search for your TLD and verify if it is available!\
\
Choose a payment method. You can opt to pay with either $SOL or $ALL (TBA)\
If some of your users got the $ALL airdrop it might be easier for you to pool up all your tokens and claim a TLD via $ALL\
\
Choose one of the two revenue plans:\
\
**1. The EqualSplit revenue plan - 250 $SOL**\
\
This revenue plan will split all future domain registration revenue between your community wallet and our protocol at a 50% - 50% rate.\
\
This can be later upgraded to the CreatorMajority plan.\
\
**2. The CreatorMajority revenue plan - 500 $SOL**\
\
This revenue plan will split all future domain registration revenue between your community wallet and our protocol at a 75% - 25% rate in your favor.\
\
Domain name registration prices are what you set them to be and some grail/rare (e.g. one-digit/two-digit) domain names can be set up with a much higher claim price than the rest!

\
After choosing a payment method and revenue plan click “MINT”. This will provide you with a TLD NFT that you can TRADE, HODL or ACTIVATE to start your TLD!\
\
TLDs are however not limited to projects! Everyone can create their own TLD, and a funny or viral idea can go a long way and propel you to new heights of notoriety!

# Banned or temporarily reserved TLDs

Offensive or Controversial Names: Please be aware that certain words with offensive or controversial connotations will not be made available for selling on the AllDomains platform. We maintain a commitment to promoting a respectful and inclusive environment for all users. Any such TLD claims will be banned and the offensive term added to the ban list!

To maintain respect and recognition for Solana's well-known brands, we have temporarily reserved certain TLDs such as .monke, .taiyo, .daa, etc.

Additionally, Web 2 or Web3 TLDs like .com, .org, .eth, .sui etc. will not be enabled because we plan on doing something special with them ðŸ˜ˆ

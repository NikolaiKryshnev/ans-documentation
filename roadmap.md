# Roadmap

### Tokenomics

As the mission is to become a decentralized protocol that the community will own, we are working on our future tokenomics that will govern and sustain the protocol and incentivize the community. Expect this to be announced step by step and a whitepaper will explain what we intend to do in the future.

### Emoji TLDs

Auctions via our own $ALL token will enable everyone a chance to win the rights to their own Emoji TLD in the form of an NFT that can be ‚Äúunpacked‚Äù to claim the TLD!

Trade it on secondary, or unpack it and start your own .ü´° TLD and start earning money as people register!

### New Features

Yes, we are working on new features that will be built with selected partners.&#x20;

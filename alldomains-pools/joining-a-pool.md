# Joining a Pool

**If someone else started a Pool for a TLD you would like to be a part of you can join in the Pool as well.**

Hit the Info button for more details (domain name prices, etc.), and if you agree with everything tap the _Join Pool_ button!\
\
A new prompt asking about how much **$ALL** you would like to lock will pop up!

You can fill a Pool up to its 90% maximum, but youâ€™ll have to wait for the initiator to **Activate** the TLD!\
\
If the initiator does not activate in a **15-day period** you can come back, reclaim your **$ALL**, and restart the Pool by yourself!

# Starting a new Pool

To start a new AllDomains Pool you will need a minimum of 20% of the total $ALL needed to fill a pool! That amounts to 136k $ALL at the moment!

After securing the needed $ALL head over to [https://alldomains.id/pools](https://alldomains.id/pools) and hit _Create Pool_!

After accepting the disclaimer, the Initiator will be prompted to fill in the desired **TLD**, the amount he wants to contribute, and the pricing scheme for domain name registration.

Here’s a few pointers to pay attention to here:

1. Shorter domain names are rarer and thus more valuable
2. Prices are per domain name per year
3. Pricing too high can deter sales
4. Pricing too low can affect your revenue

Best practice if you have a few frens that want to join the Pool is to brainstorm for the best pricing strategy!

The prices set at this point can be modified by the Initiator until the TLD Activation!\
\
Changing prices afterward will be a lot more ineffective as you will have to go through the AllDomains team!\
\
As far as TLD goes, please be advised that there are certain reserved and banned TLDs:\
[https://docs.alldomains.id/protocol/getting-a-tld/banned-or-temporarily-reserved-tlds](https://docs.alldomains.id/protocol/getting-a-tld/banned-or-temporarily-reserved-tlds)

\
So if your TLD can not be claimed please come to our discord and open a ticket and we’ll check if we can or can’t enable it for you!

# Distributing rewards

Rewards for AllDomains Pools are gathered both from domain name registrations and secondary sales royalties!\
\
Any pool contributor can, at any time, distribute the rewards gathered in a Pool!\

\
The rewards will be sent to a Program Derived Address (PDA) where they will be held in perpetuity until the contributor claims them.\
\
**You can claim your reward allocation as often or as rarely as you please, there are no limitations or cut-offs either way. All rewards are safely held in perpetuity until claimed by each contributor.**\
\
**After 180 days you can unlock and claim 50% of your initial $ALL deposit. Any rewards gathered up until this point will remain available to claim forever!**\
\
**From this point forward, however, you will not be able to claim rewards for future domain name registrations, unless you rejoin the Pool!**\
\
**Once a Pool drops below 60% (if users reclaim their $ALL), that Pool can be joined by anyone but only up to the 60% SoftEntryLimit (since the TLD has already been activated)**

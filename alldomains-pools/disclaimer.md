TLD Pools are a novel way where multiple people can own a TLD and share the fees that get generated on that TLD.

1. You enter the TLD you want to create.
2. You choose how much $ALL token you want to lock; depending on the amount, you get more fees from the domains.
3. You choose the pricing on the domain number of characters.

* The minimum amount of $ALL to be locked for a TLD pool to be opened is 136000
* The maximum amount of $ALL that can be locked in a TLD pool is 612000
* Once a pool goes over 340000, the TLD can be activated by the person who opened it
* Anyone can add more $ALL to an opened TLD pool once it has been opened to get part of the fees.
* Once a pool has been activated, no more $ALL can be added to it.
* Once $ALL token has been added to a pool, it gets locked for 15 days
* To avoid TLD Squatting, if a TLD Pool doesn't get activated the $ALL token locked in it gets released after the 15 days
* If a TLD Pool get activated, the $ALL token stays locked for 180 days
* After the 180 days pass, 50% of the locked $ALL can be withdrawn by people who locked it, and 50% goes to the AllDomains treasury.

The amounts and periods that are specified here can be changed to better support the project.

# AllDomains Pools

If you want to start a new TLD please contact us via the form here [https://alldomains.id/search-tld](https://alldomains.id/search-tld)



**The mechanics described below are no longer available for new Pools. The information is meant for the currently active pools**\


\
AllDomains opens up **Top Level Domain** (**TLD**) creation so that any project or community can distribute its own .\[anything] domains providing users with the freedom of choice for their Web3 ID.

In starting your own TLD you can harvest a share of the revenue generated by domain name registrations depending on the different revenue share plans!

### To enable a new TLD you can:

#### A. Start your own unique TLD via direct acquisition. More on this here:

{% content-ref url="../getting-a-tld/" %}
[getting-a-tld](../getting-a-tld/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

#### B. Kickstart and crowdfund a TLD using the AllDomains Pools

The AllDomains Pools program offers the easiest and friendliest way to kickstart and crowdfund a new TLD for you and your Web3 fam and proportionally share in the revenue depending on the TLD’s performance and domain name registration revenue!

All the mechanics and pricing described herein use our own $ALL token!

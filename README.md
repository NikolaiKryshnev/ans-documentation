# Overview

## What is ANS

**Alternative Name Service** (ANS) is a Solana Protocol that allows users create human readable domain names that can be used in place of a Public Key, built by **Onsol Labs**. &#x20;

A major step away from what has been built so far on Solana, **ANS** opens up **Top Level Domain** (Tld) creation so that any project or community can distribute their own _**.\[anything]**_ domains.

The mission of **ANS** is to become community owned, open source and decentralized protocol that can be used for the benefit of the Solana community.  We also aim to become a cross-chain protocol that will allow bridging domains from other blockchain to Solana and vice-versa, to bridge our **ANS** domains to all major blockchains ( eth, btc, arb, bnb, apt, sui, etc)

# Overview

## What is AllDomains

**AllDomains** is a Solana Protocol that allows users to create human-readable domain names that can be used in place of a Public Key.

**AllDomains** opens up **Top Level Domain** (TLD) creation so that any project or community can distribute its own _**.\[anything]**_ domains providing users with the freedom of choice for their Web3 ID.

The mission of **AllDomains** is to become a community-owned, open-source, and decentralized protocol that can be used for the benefit of the Solana community. We also aim to become a cross-chain protocol that will allow bridging domains from other blockchains to Solana and vice-versa and to bridge our **AllDomains** domains to all major blockchains ( eth, btc, arb, bsc, apt, sui, etc)\
\
**AllDomains** is built by **Onsol Labs ðŸ¦¾**

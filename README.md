# Overview

## What is ANS

Alternative Name Service (ANS) is a Solana Protocol that allows users create human readable domain names that can be used in place of a Public Key, built by **Onsol Labs**. &#x20;

A major step away from what has been built so far on Solana, ANS opens up Top Level Domain (Tld) creation so that any project or community can distribute their own _**.\[anything]**_ domains.

The mission of ANS is to become community owned, open source and decentralized protocol that can be used for the benefit of the Solana community.  We also aim to become a cross-chain protocol that will allow bridging domains from other blockchain to Solana and vice-versa, to bridge our ANS domains to all major blockchains ( eth, btc, arb, bnb, apt, sui, etc)



## What is a domain/TLD

\<human readable domain>.\<top-level-domain>

A WEB3 domain is a human-readable and unique address that is easy to remember & communicate and can be used in place of a Public Key.\
\
A TLD is the final component of a domain name and itâ€™s the highest level in the hierarchical **ANS** registry.

Unlike web2 domains that are hosted on the global network of Domain Name System (DNS) servers, web3 domains leverage blockchain technology making them decentralized and more importantly interact with blockchain apps and smart contracts.

#### Renewable Domains

We are revolutionising the process of domain creation by introducing renewable domains for the first time ever on the Solana platform.&#x20;

Our TLD Program, also known as TLD House, has the capacity to support an unlimited number of TLDs, all of which can take advantage of the various integrations made possible by the ANS Protocol.

#### Domain Wrapping

All domains are available for wrapping as NFTs and listing on secondary markets through our own NFT Wrapping contract (NameHouse) - a Solana Program that enables any domain from any new TLD to be wrapped as an NFT and be traded on any SOLANA NFT marketplace.



## Use cases / Benefits of using WEB3 domains

* an easy-to-remember address for sending and receiving cryptocurrency, making transactions as easy as sending an email
* the domain only belong to the owner, which can not be censored
* secure and open due to their decentralized and transparent nature
* status symbol social identity
* crypto equivalent of a custom car plate
* wrapped as NFTs can be sold on secondary markets
* can be integrated with wallets, dapps and other tools

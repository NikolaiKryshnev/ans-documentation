## What is AllDomains

**AllDomains** is a Solana Protocol that allows users to create human-readable domain names that can be used in place of a Public Key.

**AllDomains** opens up **Top Level Domain** (TLD) creation so that any project or community can distribute its own _**.\[anything]**_ domains providing users with the freedom of choice for their Web3 ID.

Since our programs can support .**\[any]** TLD we are also taking steps toward **enabling Web2 domain name registrations on Solana** and having them work for both their initially intended purposes and as Web3 domain names in parallel and moving a part of the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù domain name market to the blockchain. To this end, we have launched pilot domain name registrations for the **.ID Web2 TLD.**\
\
**AllDomains** is built by **Onsol Labs ü¶æ**

# Register a domain name

#### To r**egister a new domain:**

1. Go to[ alldomains.id](https://alldomains.id/)​
2. Search for the domain name you want. In this example, I have used "johncena”. You can now see (or not😅) if the domain name has been purchased for any of the available TLDs

3. Scroll up and down the TLD list and find your favorite one! Check the price to the right! Some of our domain names are priced in different tokens!&#x20;
4. Select the TLD your domain name should be associated with and click Buy!

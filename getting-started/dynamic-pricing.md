# Dynamic Pricing

Since some of our partnered **TLDs are priced in different SPLs** ($WIF, $SAMO, $MYRO etc.) with a high volatility rate, we have decided to **peg** the domain name registration fees **at specific $USDC** **values** (based on our partners' preferences).

This tech allowed us to implement SPL pricing for ALL our domain names.

Along with $SOL and $USDC, you can now use select partnered tokens ($WEN, $BONK, $CHAT, $SLERF) to claim ANY of our domain names. If you choose to do so, the swap to $USDC will happen instantly via the current Jupiter Exchange price and their standard 2% exchange fee.\

We have already integrated Token Extensions and soon you will have the option to claim our domains using even more tokens!&#x20;

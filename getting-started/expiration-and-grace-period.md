# Expiration and Grace Period

At the moment a 50 day Grace Period is in effect for all domain names\
\
The code for having a “grace period” is new, and our partners have not yet had a chance to integrate it.\
**PLEASE NOTE:** If your domain expires, you can no longer receive tokens with it or use it in any of our partner's products atm. So please double check your expiry date on our dashboard.\


After this code gets integrated, this is how things will work:\
👉for 45 days after your domain has expired, it will still work with all our integrations, and you retain ownership of the asset ofc\
👉for 5 more days after, you will still retain ownership of the asset without it working with our integrations\
👉After the grace period passes… well, we have some fun gamification planned for the “Close account” function (maybe a ReDAO partnership?!)\
\
We are looking forward to providing a new function for renewals as well! We call it **“gift a renewal”.**\
\
Domains in the Grace Period will still show up on Secondary Markets, but after this period passes, they will be dropped from the verified collection and will no longer show up on marketplaces. This ensures \*\*you do not risk buying an expired domain name\*\* without the possibility of renewal.\

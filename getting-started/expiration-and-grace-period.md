# Expiration and Grace Period

At the moment, a 50-day Grace Period is in effect for all domain names

However, the code for having a “grace period” is new, and our partners have not yet had a chance to integrate it.

{% hint style="info" %}
If your domain expires, you can no longer receive tokens with it or use it in any of our partner's products at the moment. So please check your expiry date on your personal dashboard.
{% endhint %}

**After this code gets integrated, this is how the Grace Period will work:**\
👉for 45 days after your domain has expired, it will still work with all our integrations, and you retain ownership of the asset\
👉for 5 more days after, you will still retain ownership of the asset without it working with our integrations\
👉After the grace period passes, the domain will no longer be usable, and the account will close

We are looking forward to providing a new **“Gift a renewal”** mechanic for our domain names.

Domains in the Grace Period will still show up on Secondary Markets, but after this period passes, they will be dropped from the verified collection and will no longer show up on marketplaces. This ensures **you do not risk buying an expired domain name** without the possibility of renewal.\

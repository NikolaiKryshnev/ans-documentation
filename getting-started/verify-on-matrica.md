# Verify on Matrica

If you're a member of a community that's implemented the Matrica domain name gating for their Discord, it's crucial to follow these steps for verification:\


1\. Go to [https://matrica.io/](https://matrica.io/) and click on the connect button. You can connect either with a Solana Wallet or your Discord account!

2\. You can now start creating your Matrica account and customize it any way you choose!

3\. If you own multiple community domain names and hold these in different wallets you can associate as many domain names/wallets as you choose here [https://matrica.io/settings](https://matrica.io/settings)

This will allow you to get membership roles on a single Discord/Telegram account for assets held across multiple wallets.

4\. After following the steps above go to the community server and look for their Matrica channel.\
Follow the steps there and you should be all set.&#x20;

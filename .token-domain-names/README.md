# .Token Domain Names

In collaboration with @Rugcheckxyz we are launching .token domain names.

Our new enhanced .token domains have been created to battle a by-product of Solana's success.&#x20;

Approximately 15,000 new tokens are launched on Solana daily, making manual verification methods impossible.\
\
Platforms such as RugCheck have been designed to allow users to check and verify a tokenâ€™s viability and identify potential risks. RugCheck requests are also at an all-time high, processing thousands of token audits every day.

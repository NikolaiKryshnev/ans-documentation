# How does {ticker}.token work?

This partnership with [@Rugcheckxyz](https://x.com/Rugcheckxyz) will allow domain names to be registered by TOKEN teams aiming at long-term stability and building trust with their users! These domain names will serve as an on-chain identity for projects hosting all the associated information and links for the project on the domain's metadata.&#x20;



There is a multitude of perks for your .token domain names:

* Token verification with automatic eligibility check via [https://rugcheck.xyz](https://rugcheck.xyz/)
* The domain acts as a verification badge for the project’s mint address&#x20;
* .Token domains can also hold associated metadata\* i.e description, website, X, telegram, discord URLs&#x20;
* Allows users to search explorers using {ticker}.token to view project funds and activity quickly without the need to locate and copy/paste addresses



You can also think of _**.token domain name**_ verification as an _**authenticity certificate:**_\
\
Getting a .token domain name for your $TICKER will allow you to:

* Verify token ownership: Authenticate the identity of the token and check that the funds are safe
* Combat fake tokens: Reduce the risk of swaps between counterfeit versions of the token
* Build community trust: Signal users that the token is trustworthy and has a long-term vision
* Improve trust scores: Many protocols prioritize verified tokens. RugCheck will perform regular automatic audits of verified tokens. Should a token fail an audit or not be renewed, the token domain will be revoked

\*Token Metadata Storage:

**Alpha version (current):** Web2 DB

**Second version:** On-chain Program that owns the Records for each Token’s Metadata. The authorities that can change the data will be @AllDomains\_ and [@Rugcheckxyz](https://x.com/Rugcheckxyz)

**Third version:** Add a more complex ACL for managing the Metadata. This could be either multiple parties or a DAO.

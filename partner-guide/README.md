# Partner Guide

If you have enabled your own TLDs: Congratulations! You are on your way to making your community far more visible in all its blockchain interactions and cementing yourself as a Solana household name!

You can now reward your most faithful community members by enabling domain name-based Matrica role verification! These roles can be used in various ways, either purely as vanity roles or by gating access to specific channels, perks (like limiting access to giveaway channels), and holder bonuses inside your Discord and/or Telegram.

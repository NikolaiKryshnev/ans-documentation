# AllDomains Pools

AllDomains opens up **Top Level Domain** (**TLD**) creation so that any project or community can distribute its own .\[anything] domains providing users with the freedom of choice for their Web3 ID.

In starting your own TLD you can harvest a share of the revenue generated by domain name registrations depending on the different revenue share plans!

### To enable a new TLD you can:

#### A. Start your own unique TLD via direct acquisition. More on this here:

{% content-ref url="getting-a-tld/" %}
[getting-a-tld](getting-a-tld/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

#### B. Kickstart and crowdfund a TLD using the AllDomains Pools

The AllDomains Pools program offers the easiest and friendliest way to kickstart and crowdfund a new TLD for you and your Web3 fam and proportionally share in the revenue depending on the TLD’s performance and domain name registration revenue!

All the mechanics and pricing described herein use our own $ALL token!

If you want to learn more about the $ALL tokenomics you can do so here: [https://docs.alldomains.id/protocol/all-token](https://docs.alldomains.id/protocol/all-token)

Let’s get into the mechanics of it $ALL

### Pool Mechanics and Tokenomics

**Total amount of $ALL a Pool can hodl: 680k $ALL (100%)**\
This is the base cost used to calculate everything below

**Minimum $ALL required to start a new Pool - EntryLimit: 136k $ALL (20%)**\
This is what a Pool Initiator will need to lock to start a new Pool! Afterward anyone (frens or foes) can lock up their $ALL alongside the Initiator and get a percentage of the revenue share!

Lock up 20%? You get 20%!\
Lock up 50%?! You get 50%!\
Lock up 90%?! You guessed it!\
\
The Initiator can deposit any amount from the start to secure a bigger piece of the pie, up to 90%!\
\
\
**Minimum $ALL required to Activate a new TLD - SettleLimit: 340k $ALL (50%)**\
This is the amount of $ALL that will need to be deposited to Activate the TLD, by which point domain name registration and revenue share can begin!\
The activation can only be done by the Initiator and he can choose to do so at 50% or any level above it!\
Choosing to Activate at 50% means half the revenue goes to the Pool contributors and half of it to the AllDomain Protocol.\
However, you can increase the percentage towards your community by adding more $ALL to the Pool!\
**Important:** The SettleLimit must be achieved in a period of 15 days! If the limit is not reached $ALL contributors can withdraw their funds! This provides protection against **TLD** squatting.\
\
\
**Maximum $ALL that can be deposited in a Pool after TLD activation - SoftEntryLimit: 418k $ALL (60%)**\
After Activating a TLD users can still choose to deposit in that Pool but only up to 60%. This allows late-comers to get in on the action even AFTER the **TLD** has been Activated!\
\
\
**Maximum $ALL that can be contributed by users - UpperLimit: 618k $ALL (90%)**\
Users can not deposit above this level. This ensures the AllDomains Protocol will always get a minimum of 10% of all revenue generated by a TLD!

After 180 days your initial $ALL deposit will be unlocked and all Pool Contributors will be able to claim 50% of it back!

### Starting a new Pool

To start a new AllDomains Pool you will need a minimum of 20% of the total $ALL needed to fill a pool! That amounts to 136k $ALL at the moment!

After securing the needed $ALL head over to [https://alldomains.id/pools](https://alldomains.id/pools) and hit _Create Pool_!

After accepting the disclaimer, the Initiator will be prompted to fill in the desired **TLD**, the amount he wants to contribute, and the pricing scheme for domain name registration.

Here’s a few pointers to pay attention to here:

1. Shorter domain names are rarer and thus more valuable
2. Prices are per domain name per year
3. Pricing too high can deter sales
4. Pricing too low can affect your revenue

Best practice if you have a few frens that want to join the Pool is to brainstorm for the best pricing strategy!

The prices set at this point can be modified by the Initiator until the TLD Activation!\
\
Changing prices afterward will be a lot more ineffective as you will have to go through the AllDomains team!\
\
As far as TLD goes, please be advised that there are certain reserved and banned TLDs:\
[https://docs.alldomains.id/protocol/getting-a-tld/banned-or-temporarily-reserved-tlds](https://docs.alldomains.id/protocol/getting-a-tld/banned-or-temporarily-reserved-tlds)

\
So if your TLD can not be claimed please come to our discord and open a ticket and we’ll check if we can or can’t enable it for you!

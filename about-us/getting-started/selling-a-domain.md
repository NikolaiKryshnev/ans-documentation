# Selling a domain

To sell a domain users need to **wrap** their domains as NFTs\
Domains can be **wrapped** (as NFTs) and **unwrapped** to reveal the real domain at any time.\
\
When a user wraps their domain:\


1. The domain is transferred to an escrow account
2. And the smart contract creates an NFT that is transferred to the user in return
3. When the NFT is unwrapped again, the program will burn the NFT and return the domain to the owner

**Users can wrap and unwrap their domain names a limitless number of times**&#x20;

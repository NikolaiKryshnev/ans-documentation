# ALL Token

## Inception

_Since day one, **AllDomains** was created with the intention to become a fully decentralized, community-owned, and managed project. A council of early contributors initiated the proposal to create and mint the $ALL Token to play a crucial role in the growth and governance of the AllDomains ecosystem and to reward users for their engagement, facilitate seamless transactions, and grant token holders the power to shape the project's future through decentralized governance. As it matures, AllDomains will transition into a fully autonomous entity._ [_**Realms**_](https://app.realms.today/dao/ELEXG9cTEJ2pgxFbEVAwushyoPvE7rrEHBgNKfv8uxzi) _will be used to conduct the governance process and to ensure a decentralized and collaborative process. A foundation will have 50% of the minted token and will be set up in the next months to represent the future AllDomains DAO._



## $ALL Token

Token Address: [BaoawH9p2J8yUK9r5YXQs3hQwmUJgscACjmTkh8rMwYL](https://explorer.solana.com/address/BaoawH9p2J8yUK9r5YXQs3hQwmUJgscACjmTkh8rMwYL)

_The $ALL Token, the native currency of AllDomains, holds significant importance in shaping the future of the project. It empowers users by granting them influence over the decision-making process and direction of AllDomains. By actively engaging with the platform and contributing to its success, users are rewarded with $ALL tokens, reinforcing the growth and sustainability of the AllDomains ecosystem. This token plays a crucial role in establishing AllDomains as a leading entity in the Web3 industry, offering users a comprehensive platform to manage their digital identities._\
\
_$ALL serves various functions within the AllDomains ecosystem, including:_

1. _Rewards: By registering AllDomainsâ€™ Web3 domains, users earn $ALL tokens through the AllDomains platform._
2. _Payments: $ALL tokens are utilized as a form of payment within the AllDomains ecosystem, facilitating transactions and enabling seamless integration with the AllDomains protocol._
3. _Governance: Token holders of $ALL will have the opportunity to actively participate in the decision-making process of AllDomains. They will be able to vote on proposals and contribute to shaping the future of the project. However, the full governance structure will be developed at a later stage_

### Initial token distribution

_Total tokens: 1.000.000.000 $ALL tokens_

_25% of the tokens will be airdropped and the remaining tokens will be vested linearly for 12 months._&#x20;

_Reminder: This is a self-funded project and most of the revenues so far were used solely to build with most of the working team not being paid for their work and efforts_

#### Future Funding

_5% of the tokens will be locked and funding the AllDomains project and allow it to grab any opportunities that come our way, such as investing in new products and services that can help the project grow_

#### Foundation

_Our token project has allocated 50% of its tokens to a vested foundation for a crucial reason: to ensure the long-term sustainability and responsible governance of the protocol. This foundation will play a pivotal role in overseeing and guiding the protocol's evolution over time._

_By vesting these tokens, we are committing to a patient and responsible approach to governance. These tokens won't be immediately accessible or tradable, but instead, they will be unlocked gradually, aligning the interests of the foundation with the protocol's success over the years._

_Moreover, we recognize the importance of a well-informed and diverse set of perspectives to guide the protocol's development. To achieve this, we will appoint a council composed of influential figures from the Solana ecosystem. These individuals will bring their expertise and insights to the table, helping the foundation make informed decisions that benefit the protocol and its users._

_In summary, the 50% token vesting for the future foundation, alongside the establishment of an experienced council, reflects our commitment to responsible governance and our determination to ensure the continued success and growth of the protocol on the Solana platform._

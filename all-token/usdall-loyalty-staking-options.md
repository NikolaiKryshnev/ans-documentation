# $ALL Loyalty Staking Options

### What Are Staking Options?

Staking Options are an incentive mechanism that grant participants who lockup their liquid tokens, the right, but not the obligation to buy tokens at a fixed future price. Users earn these free options by taking liquid token supply off the market and demonstrating loyalty to the protocol.

### Why we do it

#### Explaining Staking Options

Staking Options (SOs) are a way for people to support a project and potentially earn rewards. Our collaboration with Dual Finance provides a way to promote ecosystem loyalty having it and the end-user both extract potential maximum value out of the implementation

#### Natural Market Making

Staking Options (SOs) can help stabilize the price of a token and make it easier to buy and sell (increase liquidity). When a project gives out SOs as rewards, it's like they're betting on the token price being stable. The project benefits if the market doesn't have big price swings, while the people holding the SOs can benefit when the market is more unpredictable.

#### Treasury Revenues

AllDomains plan is to fund the treasury through product and domain revenue generation, however, we also find it necessary to reward platform usage and loyalty. Staking options integrations provide a beneficial compromise for all parties.

Revenues generated will be used to execute the roadmap plan by growing the team.

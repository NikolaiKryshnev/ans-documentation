# What is a Web3 domain/TLD

A **Web3 domain** is a human-readable and unique address that is easy to remember & communicate and can be used in place of a Public Key (more commonly known as a Wallet Address).\
\
A **TLD** is the final component of a domain name and itâ€™s the highest level in the hierarchical **AllDomains** registry.

Unlike Web 2 domains that are hosted on the global network of Domain Name System (DNS) servers, **Web3** domains leverage blockchain technology making them decentralized and more importantly allowing them to interact with blockchain apps and smart contracts.

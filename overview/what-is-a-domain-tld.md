# What is a domain/TLD

\<human readable domain>.\<top-level-domain>

A **WEB3 domain** is a human-readable and unique address that is easy to remember & communicate and can be used in place of a Public Key.\
\
A **TLD** is the final component of a domain name and itâ€™s the highest level in the hierarchical **ANS** registry.

Unlike web2 domains that are hosted on the global network of Domain Name System (DNS) servers, **web3 domains** leverage blockchain technology making them decentralized and more importantly interact with blockchain apps and smart contracts.

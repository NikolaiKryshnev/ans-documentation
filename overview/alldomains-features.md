**Renewable Domains**

We are revolutionizing the process of domain creation on Solana by introducing renewable domain names for the first time ever.

_Why renewable domain names?_

Having renewable domain names prevents people from squatting on a whole bag of domain names.

For example, let’s say you have a short name like Jeff.\
Having a single non-renewable domain name prevents other people from registering their names if the first is one taken. If anyone got there ahead of you, that domain name is theirs forever unless they’re willing to part with it.\
Having multiple TLDs with renewal fees ensures that there will always be at least one jeff.\[something] available for claiming.



**Hybrid Domain Names**

.ID was a world-first iteration of a hybrid TLD across all blockchain platforms. Claiming an .ID domain name allows users to make use of the same domain name on both Web2 and associate it with their desired Solana Public Key, allowing users and projects to extract the maximum out of their social… .ID.



**Get your TLD!**

Our TLD Program, also known as TLD House, can support an unlimited number of TLDs.

All NFT collections, games, projects, users, and Web3 communities can now create their OWN unique Web3 domain names upon application. Please contact us at https://alldomains.id/search-tld.



**Domain Wrapping**

Most of our domains are available for wrapping as **NFTs** and listed on secondary markets through our own NFT Wrapping contract - NameHouse - a Solana Program that enables any domain from any new TLD to be wrapped as an NFT and traded on any Solana NFT Marketplace.\
\
The NFT wrapper is active for the hybrid Web2 and Web3 .ID TLD. This enables Real World Asset (RWA) trading on Solana.

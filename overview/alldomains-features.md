# AllDomains Features



We are revolutionizing the process of domain creation on Solana by introducing renewable domain names for the first time ever.

_Why renewable domain names?_

Having renewable domain names prevents people from squatting on a whole bag of domain names. Having multiple TLDs with renewal fees ensures that there will always be at least one domain name you are looking for available.



**Hybrid Domain Names**

.ID was a world-first iteration of a hybrid TLD across all blockchain platforms. Claiming an .ID domain name allows users to make use of the same domain name on both Web2 and associate it with their desired Solana Public Key, allowing users and projects to extract the maximum out of their socialâ€¦ .ID.



**Going multi-chain**

As part of our ongoing pledge to bring customizable and easy-to-use domain names to everyone, AllDomains aims to expand across multiple blockchains. .Turbo, our first TLD outside of Solana, is now live on Eclipse, and we are looking forward to opening custom TLD creation for everyone on Eclipse as well. \
\
As we develop and enrich our Protocol, we are eagerly anticipating deploying on more SVM chains, and our first EVM and MOVE contracts as well.



**Get your TLD!**

Our TLD Program, also known as TLD House, can support an unlimited number of TLDs.

All NFT collections, games, projects, users, and Web3 communities can now create their OWN unique Web3 domain names upon application. Please contact us at [https://alldomains.id/launch-tld](https://alldomains.id/launch-tld)



**Domain Wrapping**

Most of our domains are available for wrapping as **NFTs** and listed on secondary markets through our own NFT Wrapping contract - NameHouse - a Solana Program that enables any domain from any new TLD to be wrapped as an NFT and traded on any Solana NFT Marketplace.

The NFT wrapper is active for the hybrid Web2 and Web3 .ID TLD. This enables Real World Asset (RWA) trading on Solana.



**Dynamic Pricing and Multiple Claim Choices**\
\
Most of our domain names can be claimed in a multitude of SPLs, and we are always looking to add more to our list!

Our domain names can also be customized to be claimed in various ways:&#x20;

* Claim via NFT
* Claim via SFT
* Claim via QR Code for IRL events
* Claim using multiple SPLs
* Claim using Token Extensions
* Claim using your own $TOKEN



**TLD Yield**
